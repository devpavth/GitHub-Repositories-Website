# GitHub Repositories Listing Page
Description

Designed a website that displays public GitHub repositories belonging to a specific user. Key features include utilizing the GitHub API to fetch public repositories, implementing pagination (10 repositories per page, total of 10 pages), and quick navigation buttons for pagination. The site features loaders to indicate API calls in progress. Each repository entry displays the repository name, description, language, and topics. Additionally, a "View on GitHub" button enables users to navigate directly to the respective repository.
